# Lending Club Case Study
> The data `given below` contains `information` about `past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not`. `The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default`, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
In this `case study`, you will `use EDA to understand` how `consumer attributes` and `loan attributes` influence the tendency of default.

## General Information

- LendingClub, founded in 2006, is a leading peer-to-peer lending platform in the United States. It connects borrowers with personal loan needs to individual investors, facilitating loans through a risk assessment system that grades borrowers. Investors can diversify and earn returns based on interest payments while having access to a secondary market.

- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (`called credit loss`). `Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed`. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. `Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study`
